# Hypothesis-Testing-Applications

This repository compiles projects on hypothesis testing applied to real-world scenarios in operations, quality, and business analytics. Each notebook is designed as a case study, showing how statistical testing supports data-driven decision making.

## Why Hypothesis Testing?
Hypothesis testing is a cornerstone of inferential statistics. It helps answer critical questions such as:
- Does a new process lead to better outcomes than the current one?
- Are two groups or conditions statistically different from each other?
- Which factors significantly influence a measurable result?
- How do we quantify uncertainty and avoid drawing conclusions from random variation?

By applying hypothesis testing, we move beyond intuition and validate decisions with statistical evidence.

## Contents

### 1. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
**Notebook:** `hypothesis-testing-application-anova.ipynb`  
- Compares the means of three or more groups to determine if at least one group differs significantly.  
- Practical use: identifying whether different production lines, treatments, or strategies yield different performance outcomes.

### 2. Chi-Squared Test
**Notebook:** `hypothesis-testing-application-chi-squared-test.ipynb`  
- Tests relationships between categorical variables (e.g., frequencies in a contingency table).  
- Practical use: checking independence between variables such as defect type and machine used, or customer preference across categories.

### 3. Regression Hypothesis Testing
**Notebook:** `hypothesis-testing-application-regression.ipynb`  
- Uses regression models to test whether predictors significantly affect an outcome.  
- Practical use: identifying bottlenecks in a process (e.g., which steps contribute most to customer wait time in a service line).

### 4. Two-Sample t-Test
**Notebook:** `hypothesis-testing-application-two-sample-t-test.ipynb`  
- Compares the means of two groups to see if the difference is statistically significant.  
- Practical use: testing whether a new method or design outperforms the current standard.

## Utility
These notebooks provide:
- Clear, step-by-step examples of statistical testing methods.  
- Visualizations that aid interpretation of results.  
- Contextual explanations tying the math back to real-world decision making.  

By exploring these examples, users will gain practical knowledge on when and how to apply different hypothesis testing techniques, along with an intuition for interpreting results.
